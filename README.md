## Features

* [Bublé](https://gitlab.com/Rich-Harris/buble) as the ES2015 compiler
* [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) for bundling
* [Eslint](http://eslint.org/) to maintain a consistent code style
* [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html) as the test runner
* [ES6 with Babel](http://babeljs.io/) for Mocha tests
* [Sinon.JS](http://sinonjs.org/) with examples for test doubles
* Node >= 6.x

## Quick start

The only development dependency of this project is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). So just make sure you have it installed. Then type few commands known to every Node developer...

```js
$ git clone https://github.com/kflash/farris.git
$ cd farris
$ npm install                   # Install Node modules listed in ./package.json
$ npm run build                 # Build a minified and a non-minified version of the library
```

... and boom! You have it all setup for you!

## Workflow

* `npm run build` - Build task that generates both minified and non-minified scripts
* `npm run build:prod` - Build task that generate a minified script
* `npm run build:dev` - Build task that generate a non-minified script
* `npm run lint:src` - Lint the source
* `npm run lint:tests` - Lint the unit tests
* `npm run clean` - Remove the coverage report - and the *dist* folder
* `npm run server:cov` - Run Isparta, a code coverage tool
* `npm run test` - Runs unit tests for both server and the browser. With Karma as the test runner
* `npm run test:browser` - Runs the unit tests for browser
* `npm run test:chrome` - Runs the unit tests for browser with Chrome
* `npm run test:node` - Runs the unit tests on the server
* `npm run test:all` - Runs all unit tests
* `npm run watch:node` - Run all unit tests for server and watch files for changes
* `npm run watch:browser` - Run all unit tests for browser and watch files for changes
* `npm run watch:chrome` - Run all unit tests for browser with Chrome and watch files for changes
* `npm run dependencies:check` - Check for latest dependencies
* `npm run dependencies:upgrade` - Upgrade latest dependencies

## Testing environment

This project uses Mocha to run your unit tests, it uses Karma as the test runner, it enables the feature that you are able to render your tests to the browser (e.g: Firefox, Chrome etc.).

To add a unit test, simply create a `.browser.js` or a `.node.js` file inside the `~../test/browser-tests/` or `~../test/node-tests/` folder. Karma will pick up on these files automatically, and Mocha and Chai will be available within your unit tests without the need to import them.

To run unit tests only for the browser, or for the server, create either a `~/.browser.js` or `~/node` file inside the same folder.

To run the tests in the project, just simply `npm run test` for both the browser and node unit tests, or `npm run test:node`. for the node environment or `npm run test:browser`. for browser tests.

To keep watching the common test suites that you are working on, simply do `npm run watch:browser` or `npm run watch:node`.

## Sinon

[Sinon.JS](http://sinonjs.org/) is also set up for test doubles - see `BatClass.common.js` for examples of both Sinon and Rewire using ES6 classes.

## Coveralls

This library is set up to integrate with Coveralls, and will automatically publish your coverage report to **coveralls.io** if you have created an account there.

Coverage reports are supported both for the browser through Karma, and for the node environment, but only the coverage report generated by Karma are posted to the coveralls.io by default.

## Bublé

[Bublé](https://gitlab.com/Rich-Harris/buble) is a blazing fast, batteries-included ES2015 compiler. Used to bundle your ES2015 files instead of Babe, and also used for the browser testsl.

## Rollup

[Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) are used as the library bundler, and also used together with Karma. It bundle down to a cleaner and more lightweight bundle then what you get with for example Webpack and Browserify.

# Know limitations

Bublé doesn't support import / export. Therefor Babel have been used for the nodeJS tests. This will be fixed ASAP when nodejS supports import / export.

I suggest read the Bublé documentation to get a better understanding about the differences between Bublé and Babel.
